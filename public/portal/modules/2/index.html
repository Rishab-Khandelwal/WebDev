<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>
  HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a simple language that uses XML elements
  to format plain text for Web browsers. HTML uses XML elements to tell Web browsers
  how to render various pieces of text. For instance the &lt;b&gt; or <b>bold</b> element
  tells the browser to render a piece of text as bold. The &lt;h1&gt; element
  is one of several header elements that tells the browser to render a piece of text
  as a header of some section of the Web page. There are many HTML elements for a
  variety of formatting options: tables, lists, paragraphs, form elements, and
  hyperlinks.

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  CSS, or Cascading Stylesheets, is a simple language used to format the look
  and feel of a Web page. Whereas HTML formats the overall structure and logical
  organization of a Web page, CSS formats how the page looks. CSS formats
  the font to use, the colors of text, background, and borders, the white
  spaces between various elements, and page layout.

  regions that can render with the content flow, render vertically or
  horizontally, render with a specific width, height, border, and white
  space based on various rules and sizes of the content. Collectively
  these rules are captured as a "box model". The
