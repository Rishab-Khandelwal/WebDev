  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

    <p>
        This module introduces MongoDB as the NoSQL database we will be
        using to persist the data for the Web applications built in
        this course. Mongoose will be covered as the API to interact
        with the MongoDB from Node.js models and services.

<h3>Introduction to MongoDB</h3>

<p>
    MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON format.

<h3>Introduction to Mongoose</h3>

<p>
    Mongoose is a Node.js module that allows integrating with MongoDB. Mongoose
    provides an API for structuring data based on Mongoose schemas and models.
    MongoDB does not impose schemas on the documents inserted into collections.
    Mongoose schemas allow enforcing structure and validating data before storing
    it to the database. Mongoose models provide a highlevel CRUD API to interact
    with the data. In this lecture we introduce the basics of the Mongoose module,
    schemas, and models.

<h3>Read Data from MongoDB</h3>

<p>
    Mongoose models allow retrieving data documents from MongoDB using various
    finder methods. Documents can be retrieved using their unique <code>_id</code>
    field or by satisfying a predicate. Finder methods can return a single
    object instance or an array of instances that match a predicate. Methods
    can be synchronous or asynchronous. Asynchronous methods should be wrapped
    into deferred promises to avoid nesting serialized queries. This lecture
    covers retrieving data from MongoDB using the Mongoose API.

<h3>Update Data in MongoDB</h3>
    Mongoose models allow updating data documents in a MongoDB database using
    various data update methods that allow insterting into the database,
    updating documents already in the database, and removing existing documents.
    Update and delete methods accept predicate objects used to identify the
    existing object we want the upda or delete. This lecture covers the varios
    data update functions.
