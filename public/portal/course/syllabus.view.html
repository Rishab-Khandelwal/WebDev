        Invite TAs and instructors to your Git repositories. They will keep track of your progress throughout the
        semester. Your commit and push history should illustrate a steady, sustained effort through a consistent
        stream of commits. We don't want to see sparse, intense activity with long periods of inactivity. Your
        commits should be small and frequent, with meaningful comments about your progress.

        Make sure you fulfill all requirements listed in the assignment document, general course requirements
        in the course videos, and lectures. Submit assignments by the due date tagging them appropriately.
        Submission date will be based on the date the tag was applied to the commit. Late submissions will lose
        1% per hour it is late, e.g., an assignment 15 hours late will receive a 15% penalty. If you need to
        resubmit the assignment, simply use the same tag in a later commit you wish graded.

<h4>Title IX</h4>

<p>
  Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the
  same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such
  as race, national origin, etc. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate
  resources here: http://www.northeastern.edu/oidi/titleix/
